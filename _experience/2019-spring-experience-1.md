[MedPrime Technologies](https://www.medprimetech.com/) is a pioneering medical device company dedicated to creating customer-centric solutions for global healthcare needs. During my second year of undergrad, I collaborated closely with the CTO through an internship to design a Python-based backend software that assists doctors in predicting the suitability of sperm samples for Human IVF.

I researched key metrics used by doctors to evaluate sperm quality by reviewing scientific papers and consulting medical professionals. Based on this, I developed Python scripts using OpenCV for analyzing microscopic sperm sample videos, implementing blob detection and object tracking to measure motility parameters. To enhance usability, I built a Tkinter-based frontend for video upload, metric calculation, and annotation. The software received positive feedback from doctors and was successfully integrated into the company's product line.
