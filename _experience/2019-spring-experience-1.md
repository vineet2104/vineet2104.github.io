MedPrime Technologies is a pioneering medical device company dedicated to creating customer-centric solutions for global healthcare needs. During my second year of undergrad, I collaborated closely with the CTO through an internship to design a Python-based backend software that assists doctors in predicting the suitability of sperm samples for Human IVF. You can find more details about the company [here](https://www.medprimetech.com/).

### Key Contributions:

* **Research:**
  - **Objective:** Identify critical metrics used by doctors to evaluate sperm quality.
  - **Actions:** Conducted an in-depth review of research papers recommended by the CTO and consulted with a panel of doctors.
  - **Results:** Established a comprehensive strategy for measuring parameters such as motility and transparency through microscopic sperm sample videos.

* **Development:**
  - **Objective:** Develop software to analyze sperm sample videos and report evaluation metrics.
  - **Actions:** Wrote Python scripts utilizing OpenCV functions, including blob detection and object tracking, to measure motility parameters.
  - **Results:** Created a robust Python-based backend software capable of calculating and reporting sperm quality metrics from microscope videos.

* **Demonstration:**
  - **Objective:** Create a user-friendly frontend to demonstrate the software to doctors.
  - **Actions:** Developed a simple Tkinter-based Python frontend providing a UI for uploading videos, calculating metrics, and annotating sample videos.
  - **Results:** The project received positive feedback from doctors, and the core scripts were integrated into the company's product line.
