### Key Contributions:

* **Improving Diversity of Video Classification Datasets:**
  - **Objective:** Develop a framework to enhance the diversity of a small in-lab collected gesture video dataset.
  - **Actions:**
    - Researched state-of-the-art synthetic video generation methods and identified necessary augmentations for robust training.
    - Utilized computer vision libraries like OpenCV and Pillow to implement augmentations such as blurring, random cropping, and affine transformations.
  - **Results:**
    - Developed an automated framework that increased video samples by 100 times through systematic application of designed augmentations.

* **Training Deep Learning Models for Video Gesture Classification:**
  - **Objective:** Utilize the synthetic dataset to train and compare state-of-the-art methods for video gesture classification.
  - **Actions:**
    - Conducted an extensive literature review to identify GAN-based methods as optimal for performance on limited gold-standard datasets.
    - Trained and evaluated models like MocoGAN and TecoGAN against competitive benchmarks.
  - **Results:**
    - Achieved a 10% relative improvement in classification performance over competitive baselines.
    - Identified limitations of mechanical augmentations and recommended the use of more sophisticated diffusion models for better performance.
