I analyzed â‚¬8.4M in correction amounts for the Belgium Business Division, identifying invoicing errors and developing seven KPIs to enhance billing accuracy while cataloging SAP tables for data aggregation. For the Mexico Business Division, I debugged 10+ data metrics and developed knowledge models for Overdues and Accounts Receivable, enabling effective rework tracking. I also designed three global sales order trackers and documented analysis dashboards for business-friendly use.
