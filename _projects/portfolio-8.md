DisfluencyFixer is a speech-to-speech disfluency correction tool for English and Hindi, leveraging ASR, Disfluency Correction (DC), and TTS models to transform disfluent speech into fluent, coherent output. It provides real-time speech transcripts, identifies disfluency types and counts, and serves as a fluency improvement tool for language learners. Subjective evaluation scores of 4.26 (ASR), 4.29 (DC), and 4.42 (ease-of-use) highlight its effectiveness. DisfluencyFixer is openly accessible, offering a seamless solution for improving spoken fluency in multilingual settings.
