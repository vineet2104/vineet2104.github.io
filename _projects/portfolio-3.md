HiFi-CS is a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) framework designed to improve Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS)â€”enabling robots to grasp objects based on natural language queries. By hierarchically applying Featurewise Linear Modulation (FiLM), it enhances visual grounding for complex, attribute-rich text descriptions in cluttered environments. HiFi-CS integrates a frozen VLM with a lightweight decoder, outperforming baselines in closed vocabulary settings while being 100x smaller. It also improves open-vocabulary grounding by guiding object detectors like GroundedSAM. Validated on a 7-DOF robotic arm, HiFi-CS achieves 90.33% visual grounding accuracy in real-world tabletop experiments.
