I am a second year PhD student at NYU working on the application of Vision Language Models in Robotics. I completed my Bachelors degrees in Physics and Masters in Artificial Intelligence both at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (India), and I use my background to understand the physical world, developing AI models that can reason with real world interactions. These AI models are derivatives of powerful foundational models like ChatGPT, and my research is motivated to decipher how much these models understand the real world. In short, yes I'm trying to make robots as smart as humans! But don't worry, we're far from fully autonomous artificial beings (as of 2025!)

At my core, I'm a problem solver who likes to solve the toughest of problems. My interests are quite diverse - data science, mathematics, physics, stock markets and I try my best to stay connected with the latest of updates in these areas. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NfLWC3lqW8RSqygV400MPgQwEhCoIddl/view?usp=sharing). I am actively looking for internship opportunities in applied AI for Summer 2025/2026.
