I am a second-year PhD student at NYU, researching the application of Vision-Language Models in Robotics. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Physics and Master’s in Artificial Intelligence from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (India), leveraging my background to develop AI models that can reason about real-world interactions. These models are built on powerful foundation models like ChatGPT, and my research aims to uncover the extent of their real-world understanding. In short—yes, I'm trying to make robots as smart as humans! But don't worry, we're still far from fully autonomous artificial beings (as of 2025!).

At my core, I'm a problem solver who likes to solve the toughest of problems. My interests are quite diverse - data science, mathematics, physics, stock markets and I try my best to stay connected with the latest of updates in these areas. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NfLWC3lqW8RSqygV400MPgQwEhCoIddl/view?usp=sharing). I am actively looking for internship opportunities in applied AI for Summer 2025/2026.
